### BanterBrain Buddy v1.0.8 feature & bugfix release

**This program requires a valid OpenAI ChatGPT API key to operate _or_ a local Ollama installation.** 

Please report all bugs to the [Discord](https://discord.gg/2EEhKpEMMT) or here on [Github](https://github.com/WhiskerWeirdo/BanterBrain-Buddy/issues). 

### Requisites to run
This release depends on .NET Runtime Desktop 8. After installation and trying to run BBB you will be asked to download and install this from the Microsoft website if you do not have it installed yet.

You can also download Runtime Desktop here: [Windows Runtime Desktop 8.0.4](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-8.0.4-windows-x64-installer)

### KNOWN ISSUES
- Plugging in/out audio devices while BBB runs can have an unforseen effect on your input/output and throw errors
- No ability to check for Twitch followers
- ElevenLabs API check (preloading voices) can sometimes timeout after 15 seconds. This makes the first time you use it, probably quite a bit slower when editing persona's, but that's only until it works. This cannot really be fixed on my side.

### RELEASE V1.0.8 RELEASE
New:
- Completely new settings format so you can now blame me, not Windows if your settings disappear. _The old settings are not yet deleted so reverting to 1.0.7 if you have serious issues will be a fallback_
- Ability to add notable viewers where you can personalize the LLM response for that viewer
- Ability to use the newer local Windows TTS voices
- Button to forcibly reset the current chat history with the LLM (chatgpt/ollama) without restarting BBB

Fixed:
- Ollama restarting a conversation every time you send a message. Now it has a conversation history
- gifted subs fixed see https://github.com/WhiskerWeirdo/BanterBrain-Buddy/issues/86
- Authorization to Twitch issue fixed
- Timeout on OpenAI API key check to prevent hanging at startup

### RELEASE V1.0.7 RELEASE
New:
- Allow the ElevenLabs 2.5 Turbo API at 50% the cost of the default one https://elevenlabs.io/blog/introducing-turbo-v2-5
- You can now filter bad words in Twitch messages and triggers! If a bad word is found, the message is completely ignored by BBB

Fixed:
- Not saving Streamer name on exit https://github.com/WhiskerWeirdo/BanterBrain-Buddy/issues/74
- Not saving LLM Language setting on exit https://github.com/WhiskerWeirdo/BanterBrain-Buddy/issues/75
- Authorization to twitch failing due to ClientID not being correct in settings file  https://github.com/WhiskerWeirdo/BanterBrain-Buddy/issues/78

New:
- Allowing fully custom Twitch and intermediary LLM messages.
 **Note:** There is no protection to what you enter or remove there! Be careful!

### RELEASE V1.0.5 RELEASE
- Now supports OpenAI's ChatGPT 4 Omni Mini model.

Not yet fixed:

### RELEASE V1.0.2 RELEASE
New:
- Spanish added to OpenAI/Whisper TTS voices
- ElevenLabs now defaults to the higher quality and multilingual v2 API speech model

Note: this does not fix the English used in some prompts that are embedded in BBB, which can generate some response oddities from the used LLM. This will be fixed in a later release.

### RELEASE V1.0.1 RELEASE
New:
- Talking rate for TTS Voices that support it  https://github.com/WhiskerWeirdo/BanterBrain-Buddy/issues/62

## About
BanterBrain Buddy is a Windows .Net based Speech-To-Text to LLM to Text-To-Speech program for general entertainment or as a streaming companion.

The goal is to provide local PC or streaming entertainment by talking to an AI and hearing the responses back, based on a role you can set for the AI. The goa is to support both local only-resources or API services.
For the streaming side of things, integration with Twitch to respond to chat commands and stream events is planned.

Example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TawapT1WEEo

## Social
Come talk or chat at https://discord.banterbrain.tv

## Build instructions
[todo]
tldr: use Visual studio 2022 with .net 8. 

## Resources for local and API
- for most API-services you need a paid account using a creditcard! (OpenAI, Azure, Google, Deepgram, etc.)
- local based LLM's like Ollama take significant resources; expect to need at least 8 GB memory for a basic model and a solid GPU if you want fast responses
