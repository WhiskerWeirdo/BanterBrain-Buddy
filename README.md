### v0.1.4-BETA release of BanterBrain Buddy.
Download: https://github.com/WhiskerWeirdo/BanterBrain-Buddy/releases/tag/0.1.0-beta

**This BETA requires a valid OpenAI ChatGPT API key to operate _or_ a local Ollama installation.** 

This is a beta, please report all bugs to the discord or here on github. 

### Requisites to run
This release depends on .NET Runtime Desktop 8. After installation and trying to run BBB you will be asked to download and install this from the Microsoft website if you do not have it installed yet.

You can also download Runtime Desktop here: [Windows Runtime Desktop 8.0.4](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-8.0.4-windows-x64-installer)

### KNOWN ISSUES
- Plugging in/out audio devices while BBB runs can have an unforseen effect on your input/output and throw errors
- No ability to check for Twitch followers
- ElevenLabs API check (preloading voices) can sometimes timeout after 15 seconds. This makes the first time you use it, probably quite a bit slower when editing persona's, but that's only until it works. This cannot really be fixed on my side.

### RELEASE V0.1.4 BETA
Thank you @max aka Dadflaps#1337 for your bug reports and feedback

fixed:
- https://github.com/WhiskerWeirdo/BanterBrain-Buddy/issues/45 fixed; due to logic error whenn the authorized API key and monitoring channel were different people
- https://github.com/WhiskerWeirdo/BanterBrain-Buddy/issues/46 fixed; in combination with autostart checked, after the settings window Twitch would disconnect
- https://github.com/WhiskerWeirdo/BanterBrain-Buddy/issues/49 fixed; username of broadcaster was not used in streamer/local STT recordings
- https://github.com/WhiskerWeirdo/BanterBrain-Buddy/issues/47 fixed; setting was not saved when opening Settings panel.

Improvement:
- Switching windows now saves settings more often to prevent setting-data loss
- Main window now calls "Persona"  "Streamer Persona" to make it more obvious that's only used for the Speech-To-Text/streamer.

### RELEASE V0.1.3 BETA
- Enabling Ollama in the settings screen while its not running now handled gracefully instead of crashing. Testing Ollama now also handles issues more gracefully instead of crashing.
- 
### RELEASE V0.1.2 BETA
- Elevenlabs speed optimization. It only needs to load the voices when you are busy editing persona's that use Elevenlabs and not in other events.

### RELEASE V0.1.1 BETA
- Fixes and validations for invalid or empty API keys so that the program does not crash. It fails gracefully and tells you the key is invalid.
 
### RELEASE V0.1.0 BETA
- many fixes for text input issues, like saving on the correct time or not allowing empty fields
- Twitch OAUTH fix to allow configurable redirect if default port is occupied
- Elevenlabs optimizations
- Fixes to PTT button
- Fixes to Hotkeys
- Added timestamps to Main text window 
- many code hygiene fixes
- Ollama roletext fix & now Ollama supports and remembers previous content

## About
BanterBrain Buddy is a Windows .Net based Speech-To-Text to LLM to Text-To-Speech program for general entertainment or as a streaming companion.

The goal is to provide local PC or streaming entertainment by talking to an AI and hearing the responses back, based on a role you can set for the AI. The goa is to support both local only-resources or API services.
For the streaming side of things, integration with Twitch to respond to chat commands and stream events is planned.

## Social
Come talk or chat at https://discord.banterbrain.tv

## Build instructions
[todo]
tldr: use Visual studio 2022 with .net 8. 

## Resources for local and API
- for most API-services you need a paid account using a creditcard! (OpenAI, Azure, Google, Deepgram, etc.)
- local based LLM's like GPT4All take significant resources; expect to need at least 8 GB memory for a basic model and a solid GPU if you want fast responses

## Roadmap


### Short term roadmap
- make beta stable
