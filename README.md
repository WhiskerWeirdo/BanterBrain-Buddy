## About
BanterBrain Buddy is a Windows .Net based Speech-To-Text to LLM to Text-To-Speech program for general entertainment or as a streaming companion.

The goal is to provide local PC or streaming entertainment by talking to an AI and hearing the responses back, based on a role you can set for the AI. The goa is to support both local only-resources or API services.
For the streaming side of things, integration with Twitch to respond to chat commands and stream events is planned.

## Social
Come talk or chat at https://discord.banterbrain.tv

## Build instructions
[todo]
tldr: use Visual studio 2022 with .net 8. 

## Resources for local and API
- for most API-services you need a paid account using a creditcard! (OpenAI, Azure, Google, Deepgram, etc.)
- local based LLM's like GPT4All take significant resources; expect to need at least 8 GB memory for a basic model and a solid GPU if you want fast responses
